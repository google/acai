/**
 * Annotates a {@link com.google.acai.TestingService} as depending on another testing service.
 *
 * <p>A testing service annotated as depending on another its methods will be executed after the
 * methods of the service it depends upon when executing {@code BeforeClass} or {@code Before}
 * methods. When running {@code After} methods the dependent service's methods will be run
 * before those of the service it depends upon (i.e., the setup ordering is the opposite of the
 * setup ordering).
 *
 * <p>This is useful in the case where your test environment starts multiple services which depend
 * on each other being available in order to start.
